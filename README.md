This project is about the techniques of finding the desease of a plant.
# Leaf Disease Detection
This project uses machine learning and image processing techniques to detect and classify diseases in plant leaves. Early identification of leaf diseases is crucial for maintaining plant health and maximizing agricultural productivity. With this tool, farmers and agricultural researchers can upload leaf images and receive instant diagnostics, helping them take timely action to protect crops.

# Features:
Automated detection of multiple leaf diseases.
Supports image uploads for real-time disease classification.
Utilizes deep learning models for high accuracy.
Easy-to-use interface for non-technical users.
Customizable and scalable for various crops and environments.
# Technologies Used:
- Python (TensorFlow, Keras)[version = 3.6] 
- Framework = Flask
- OpenCV for image preprocessing.
- Machine Learning/Deep Learning for classification.
- Flask/Django for the web interface (optional).
# Future Enhancements:
- Support for more crop species and diseases.
- Mobile application for on-the-go disease detection.
- Integration with remote sensing data for large-scale monitoring.
# Contribution:
Feel free to contribute by improving the model, adding more features, or reporting bugs!
