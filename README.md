# Leaf Disease Detection üçÉ
This project uses machine learning and image processing techniques to detect and classify diseases in plant leaves. Early identification of leaf diseases is crucial for maintaining plant health and maximizing agricultural productivity. With this tool, farmers and agricultural researchers can upload leaf images and receive instant diagnostics, helping them take timely action to protect crops.

# Overview <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wuPi7sk.png">
Leaf diseases can lead to significant agricultural losses. This project builds a classifier that detects and categorizes leaf diseases from images. It leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to automate the process, making it accessible for farmers and researchers.

# Features <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3J1tbQN.png">
Automated detection of multiple leaf diseases.
Supports image uploads for real-time disease classification.
Utilizes deep learning models for high accuracy.
Easy-to-use interface for non-technical users.
Customizable and scalable for various crops and environments.


# Model <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LJWOyWD.png">
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. Key technologies include:

- TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building and training the neural network.
- OpenCV: For image preprocessing.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

The model architecture includes several convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and dense layers. It uses ReLU activation and Softmax for the final classification.
